Architecture Board
==================

The board’s objective is to facilitate a broader conversation with the engineers at Gilt who are making daily decisions on the technology they are using within their teams. We also hope to make the overall discussion of architecture more inclusive and more transparent.


Architecture Councils
---------------------

We believe that a good way to accomplish the goals of the board is to facilitate periodic in person meetings which we are calling Architecture Councils. All engineers are invited to these meetings. We alternate the host location between Dublin and New York (engineers not based in the host location can join via GVC).

We expect to convene these meetings for all engineers and architects to share best practices every three to five months.

Example of agenda items for the architecture councils:
    - Review key RFCs
    - Design reviews for systems we admire
    - Discussion of a proposal on standards that the arch board is preparing
    - Workshops for architecture topics of general interest


General Structure
-----------------

  - The principal and distinguished members of Gilt Tech constitute the permanent members of the architecture board.
  - One member of the board will serve as Chair. The chair is elected to a one-year term.
  - Attendance at board meetings is voluntary, however each department should be represented by at least one member.
  - In order to ensure broad technical and departmental representation, the board should review its composition before each Architecture Council and may appoint additional members to one-year terms, subject to BDFL approval.
  - All board members continue to serve as first class team members as their primary role.
  - Tech exec and team management will encourage teams to actively plan time for architecture into all ongoing work.
  - The board reports to SVP Engineering.

High-level responsibility
-------------------------

  - The architecture board will provide comments into company wide review process on duties related to “Engineering Architect” ingredient
  - Define job description for "architect" ingredient
  - Chair responsibilities:
    - Convene regular board meetings as necessary and at least twice per month.
    - Share agenda + minutes with all of tech from each board meeting - most important here is to make transparent all of the decisions, non decisions, and discussions
    - Convene Architecture Councils
  - Primary responsibilities:
    - Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
    - Highlight best practices across all our teams
    - Minimize duplication of effort across Gilt
    - Define standards for inter team communication
    - Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways
    - Assess specific technologies - both already at Gilt or not yet in use at Gilt
    - Maintain a Gilt Tech Radar
  - Allocate portion of time if other architects would like their help
  - Publish and maintain a simple means to contact the board for help with issues and visibility of the feedback loop through to resolution
  - Establish an annual review to ensure all standards are actively reviewed annually.

Board Meetings
--------------

  - Each department can decide which board member(s) should represent the department at board meetings. This does not have to be the same person every time.
  - The main goal of the meetings is to share information as well as discuss and decide on architectural topics that affect the entire tech organization.
  - The meeting agenda will be distributed in advance of every meeting.
  - All members can raise topics to be discussed at board meetings.
  - Each meeting has a scribe to keep track of the minutes.
  - Meeting minutes are shared with all of tech after each meeting.

Decision making process
-----------------------

  - Decisions by the board must be announced at least one week in advance via email to the architecture board google group <arch-board@gilt.com> to give
    all members enough time to prepare and a chance to attend the meeting when the decision is made.
  - All members present at the board meeting when the decision is made, can vote.
  - The SVP Engineering (BDFL) has passive membership on the architecture board with no voting rights, but has the right to veto decisions.
  - Decisions are made via majority vote.
  - In case of a stalemate, the chair has the deciding vote.
