Introducing the Architecture Board

We’re excited to introduce the Architecture Board - a new initiative designed to evolve and share the overall technical architecture at Gilt.

The board’s objective is to facilitate a broader conversation with the engineers at Gilt who are making daily decisions on the technology they are using within their teams. We also hope to make the overall discussion of architecture more inclusive and more transparent.

Some of the specific objectives are to: 

Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
Highlight best practices across all our teams 
Minimize duplication of effort across Gilt
Define standards for inter team communication
Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways
Assess specific technologies - already at Gilt or not yet in use at Gilt

We believe that a good way to accomplish these goals is to facilitate quarterly in person meetings - essentially mini “arch summits” - which we are calling Architecture Councils. We will be inviting the engineers who are focused on architecture for their teams to these meetings, alternating the host location between Dublin and New York (engineers not based in the host location can join via GVC).

In simple terms, the goal is to work together to create a coherent vision for Gilt architecture. The success of the council will be based on the contributions of the participants across all of our teams.

Next steps:
The initial arch board has been formed based on the former members of the architecture team who now are working directly with teams vs. on an independent architecture team. Andrey Kartashov w/ mobile, Peter Barron on Real Time Data, and Gregor Heine w/ Team 42. Andres Pereira has also accepted the 4th position on the inaugural arch board, while continuing his work with the infrastructure team. Gregor has been nominated and accepted the position of Arch Board chair - so look forward to hearing more from him!
The Arch board is working on a more detailed job description for the architects on each team. Once complete, we will work with the team leads to identify the engineers most directly focused on architecture on each team.
These engineers will then receive an invitation to the inaugural Architecture Council scheduled for November 4th, hosted in New York.

One other quick note - Chris Hazlett had mentioned earlier we would be sharing more details on the distinguished / fellow individual contributor levels at Gilt. The one key aspect is that we really want these positions to be peer nominated, including the participation of the architecture board (more details in document below).

We are really excited by the architecture board and the impact it can have here at Gilt - definitely looking forward to kicking off the first council in November!
