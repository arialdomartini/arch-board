Architecture Board
==================

## Objective
The board's objective is to facilitate a broader conversation with people who are making daily decisions on the technology they are using withing their teams.

We also hope to make the overall discussion of architecture more inclusive and more transparent.

## Architecture Board
We believe that a good way to accomplish the goals of the board is to facilitate periodic in person meetings which we call Architecture Boards. All people can attend to these meetings. We alternate host location amongst the main quarters. People not based in the host location can join remotely.

We expect to convene these meetings for all engineers and architects to share best practices every 2 weeks.

The main goal of the board meetings is to take architectural decisions as well as to discuss and share information on architectural topics that affect the entire tech organization.

Example of agenda items for the Architecture Boards:

* Discussion of a proposal on standards
* Design reviews for systems we admire
* Decisions on new technologies adoption.
