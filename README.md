Architecture Board
==================

The boardâ€™s objective is to facilitate a broader conversation with the engineers at Gilt who are making daily decisions on the technology they are using within their teams. We also hope to make the overall discussion of architecture more inclusive and more transparent.

Some of the specific objectives are to: 

  - Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
  - Highlight best practices across all our teams 
  - Minimize duplication of effort across Gilt
  - Define standards for inter team communication
  - Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways
  - Assess specific technologies - already at Gilt or not yet in use at Gilt

We believe that a good way to accomplish these goals is to facilitate quarterly in person meetings which we are calling Architecture Councils. All engineers are invited to these meetings. We alternate the host location between Dublin and New York (engineers not based in the host location can join via GVC).

In simple terms, the goal is to work together to create a coherent vision for Gilt architecture. The success of the council will be based on the contributions of the participants across all of our teams.
