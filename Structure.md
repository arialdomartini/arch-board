General Structure
-----------------

  - Target 4 members at any given time. Over time may develop as % of engineers or % of teams in Gilt Tech
  - 24 month term
  - Members can serve no more than 2 consecutive terms
  - One member of the board will be the Chair. When the chair rotates off the board, the board will decide its own chair.
  - Expect 25% of time devoted to arch board. All board members continue to serve as first class team members as their primary role. To help facilitate this time:
  - Architecture board will provide comments into company wide review process on duties related to “Engineering Architect” ingredient
  - Tech exec and team management will encourage teams to actively plan time for architecture into all ongoing work
  - Reports to CTO

High level responsibility
-------------------------

  - Define job description for "architect" ingredient
  - Chair responsibilities:
    - Convene regular board meetings as necessary - initial thought is the architecture board should meet on its own at least twice / month. 
    - Share agenda + minutes with all of tech from each board meeting - most important here is to make transparent all of the decisions, non decisions, and discussions
    - Convene quarterly meeting for all architects to share best practices. We will call this the “Architecture Council”. Example of agenda items for the architecture councils:
    - Review key RFCs
    - In person design reviews for systems we admire
    - Discussion of a proposal on standards that the arch board is preparing
  - Primary responsibilities:
    - Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
    - Highlight best practices across all our teams 
    - Minimize duplication of effort across Gilt
    - Define standards for inter team communication
    - Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways
    - Assess specific technologies - both already at Gilt or not yet in use at Gilt
  - Allocate portion of time if other architects would like their help
  - Publish and maintain a simple means to contact the board for help with issues and visibility of the feedback loop through to resolution
  - Define schedule to ensure all standards are actively reviewed for modification / cancellation on a set interval (maybe every 12, 18 or 24 months).
