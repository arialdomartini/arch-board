General idea is to move away from an "Architecture Team" and create an
"Architecture Board" with elected members (24 month terms), clear
responsibilities, and regular meetings with all engineers filling the
"Engineering Architect" ingredient on their team.

Architecture board
------------------

  - Target 4 members at any given time. Over time may develop as % of engineers or % of teams in Gilt Tech
  - 24 month term
  - Members can serve no more than 2 consecutive terms
  - One member of the board will be the Chair. When the chair rotates off the board, the board will decide its own chair.
  - Expect 25% of time devoted to arch board. All board members continue to serve as first class team members as their primary role. To help facilitate this time:
  - Architecture board will provide comments into company wide review process on duties related to “Engineering Architect” ingredient
  - Tech exec and team management will encourage teams to actively plan time for architecture into all ongoing work
  - Reports to CTO

High level responsibility
-------------------------

  - Define job description for “architect” ingredient
  - Chair responsibilities:
    - Convene regular board meetings as necessary - initial thought is the architecture board should meet on its own at least twice / month. 
    - Share agenda + minutes with all of tech from each board meeting - most important here is to make transparent all of the decisions, non decisions, and discussions
    - Convene quarterly meeting for all architects to share best practices. We will call this the “Architecture Council”. Example of agenda items for the architecture councils:
    - Review key RFCs
    - In person design reviews for systems we admire
    - Discussion of a proposal on standards that the arch board is preparing
  - Primary responsibilities:
    - Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
    - Highlight best practices across all our teams 
    - Minimize duplication of effort across Gilt
    - Define standards for inter team communication
    - Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways
    - Assess specific technologies - both already at Gilt or not yet in use at Gilt
  - Allocate portion of time if other architects would like their help
  - Publish and maintain a simple means to contact the board for help with issues and visibility of the feedback loop through to resolution
  - Define schedule to ensure all standards are actively reviewed for modification / cancellation on a set interval (maybe every 12, 18 or 24 months).

Member replacement
------------------

  - Term Start Date (TSD) determined as day current architecture board member will leave the board
  - TSD - 1 quarter: Nominations solicited at the monthly architecture meeting
    - Qualifications:
      - Engineer must have served as a team “Engineering Architect” for at least 12 months during tenure at Gilt. 12 months does not need to be consecutive.
      - Engineer must not have served on architecture board in past 12 months (from TSD)
  - TSD - 1.5 months: Arch board makes decision on next member
  - TSD - 1 month: Nominee announced. Joins board as observer until TSD
  - TSD: Current architecture board member leaves. TSD joins as active member for 2 year term

Initial Board
-------------

Initial members will be the current architecture team, with term expiration set to enable 1 person to rotate approximately every 6 months:

  - Andrey: 11/1/14 - 5/1/16
  - Gregor: 11/1/14 - 11/1/15 - current arch chair
  - Pete: 11/1/14 - 5/1/15
  - Andres: 11/1/14 - 11/1/16
  - Chris: 11/1/14 - 11/1/16

Decision making process
-----------------------

  - All board decisions are ideally made by unanimous consent of all current architecture board members and the CTO.
  - In the event that a decision cannot be made:
    - Any proposal can be voted on by the board.
    - If 50% or more of the board members approve the proposal, the proposal is submitted to CTO for final review.
    - In the event of a tie, the chair single handedly decides whether or not the recommendation proceeds
    - CTO has sole discretion to approve or reject a proposal

  - Board chair will share all decisions with tech and also provide:
    - a directory of historical decisions
    - published internal board metric for how decisions are being made - e.g. ideally we’d like to see over ⅔ of the decisions made through consent.
    - In some cases, there may be some urgency to make a decision requiring a timebox set for exploratory work before a decision is made. These situations and timelines can be identified through the normal decision making process. In the event there is no decision at the end of the timebox, CTO solely reserves the right to make the decision or to extend the timebox.
