General Structure
-----------------

  - The architecture board consists of all principal and distinguished engineers in Gilt Tech.
  - One member of the board will be the Chair. The chair is elected on a 12 month term.
  - Attendance at board meetings is voluntary, however each department should be represented by at least one member.
  - Expect 25% of time devoted to arch board. All board members continue to serve as first class team members as their primary role. To help facilitate this time:
  - Tech exec and team management will encourage teams to actively plan time for architecture into all ongoing work
  - Reports to Senior VP Engineering

High level responsibility
-------------------------

  - The architecture board will provide comments into company wide review process on duties related to “Engineering Architect” ingredient
  - Define job description for "architect" ingredient
  - Chair responsibilities:
    - Convene regular board meetings as necessary - initial thought is the architecture board should meet on its own at least twice / month. 
    - Share agenda + minutes with all of tech from each board meeting - most important here is to make transparent all of the decisions, non decisions, and discussions
    - Convene triannual (every 4 months) meeting for all architects to share best practices. We will call this the “Architecture Council”. Example of agenda items for the architecture councils:
      - Review key RFCs
      - In person design reviews for systems we admire
      - Discussion of a proposal on standards that the arch board is preparing
  - Primary responsibilities:
    - Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
    - Highlight best practices across all our teams 
    - Minimize duplication of effort across Gilt
    - Define standards for inter team communication
    - Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways
    - Assess specific technologies - both already at Gilt or not yet in use at Gilt
  - Allocate portion of time if other architects would like their help
  - Publish and maintain a simple means to contact the board for help with issues and visibility of the feedback loop through to resolution
  - Define schedule to ensure all standards are actively reviewed for modification / cancellation on a set interval (maybe every 12, 18 or 24 months).

Board Meetings
--------------

  - The board meets every 2 weeks.
  - Each department can decide which board member(s) should represent the department at board meetings. This does not have to be the same person every time.
  - The main goal of the meetings is to share information as well as discuss and decide on archtectural topics that affect the entire tech organization.
  - The meeting agenda will be distributed in advance of every meeting.
  - All members can raise topics to be discussed at board meetings.
  - Each meeting has a scribe to keep track of the minutes.
  - Meeting minutes are shared with all of tech after each meeting.

Decision making process
-----------------------

  - Decisions by the board must be announced at least one week in advance via email to the architecture board google group <arch-board@gilt.com> to give
    all members enough time to prepare and a chance to attend the meeting when the decision is made.
  - All members present at the board meeting when the decision is made, can vote.
  - The SVP Engineering (BDFL) has passive membership on the architecture board with no voting rights, but has the right to veto decisions.
  - Decisions are made via majority vote.
  - In case of a stalemate, the chair has the deciding vote.
